  ### Text Based Game
- This is a text based game that involves going through rooms and collecting items to take down zeus.
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/Adrian1161/IT-145)
- Enhancements for this project are going to be add a better game menu, convert the program into c++, and add a database to store the games rooms and items. I want to add a better menu the orginal one I created is not the best but with the new skills I learned I can improve it. So one of the big problems I have with it currently is that you have to type go [north, east, south, or west] to go a certain direction. I want to make this more simple to avoid any issues that may come up for example, the user makes a typo. The next thing I want to do is move the program over to c++ so that I can show that I understand how both of these languages work. Also most of my recent work has been in c++. The last is to implement a database to make it easier to expand items or rooms a lot more easier. Since with a database I would make new entires to a table.
