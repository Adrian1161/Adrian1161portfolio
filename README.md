- Enhancements for this project are going to be add a better game menu, convert the program into c++, and add a database to store player game progress so they can continue where they left off at. I want to add a better menu the original one I created is not the best but with the new skills I learned I can improve it. So one of the big problems I have with it currently is that you have to type go [north, east, south, or west] to go a certain direction. I want to make this more simple to avoid any issues that may come up for example, the user makes a typo. The next thing I want to do is move the program over to c++ so that I can show that I understand how both of these languages work. Also most of my recent work has been in c++. The last is to implement a database to save player progress
